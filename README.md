The project is a real-time virtual painting app that uses hand tracking via MediaPipe and OpenCV. The index finger acts as a brush to draw on a digital canvas. Users can change colors, use an eraser, clear the canvas, and save drawingsâ€”all by pointing at the webcam. The eraser size auto-adjusts based on finger distance.
